**Introduction**

Malaria is a life threatening disease caused by parasites that are transmitted through female mosquitoes. Symptoms including fever, headache, and chills appear within 10-15 days after the mosquito bite. If not treated this could lead to death or severe illness. This dataset is orginally hosted by NIH and shared on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/iarunava/cell-images-for-detecting-malaria. The dataset contains 27,558 iages of cells with equal instances of parasitized and unparasitized cells.

**Purpose**

The purpose of this project was to detect parasitized and unparasitized cells to see if an individual has malaria or not.
